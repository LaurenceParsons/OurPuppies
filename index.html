      <p>This is what we love about the puppies</p>
        <ol>
            <li>They will be a new part to our family life, and everyone is excited</li>
            <li>I'm sure they are going to be very naughty :-)</li>
            <li>They are going to be fun</li>
            <li>They are going to be much loved</li>
        </ol>
      <p>These might be the challenges</p>
       <ol>
            <li>living with the cats</li>
            <li>we have never had a dog in the family </li>
            <li>training them</li>
        </ol>
